### THIS IS YOUR README

I drew 12 hearts to represent people's energy throughout the day. 12 corresponds to 24 hours in a day. Every morning is the time when people have the highest energy, and then energy decreases as time goes by. I used if to set it up. Every 2 hours starting in the morning, the color of a heart will become lighter, which represents the loss of energy.
